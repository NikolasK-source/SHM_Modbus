# Shared Memory Modbus Client Simulator

This project is a a collection of applications to simulate a Modbus TCP/RTU client. 

It contains the following tools:

- General Shared Memory Tools:
  - [Shared Memory Dump](https://nikolask-source.github.io/dump_shm/)
  - [Shared Memory Write](https://nikolask-source.github.io/write_shm/)
  - [Shared Memory Random](https://nikolask-source.github.io/shared_mem_random/)
- Modbus Clients:
  - [RTU](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_rtu_client_shm/)
  - [TCP](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_tcp_client_shm/)
- Modbus Shared Memory Tools:
  - [STDIN to Modbus SHM](https://nikolask-source.github.io/stdin_to_modbus_shm/)

In addition, a start script is included, which also provides a guided mode.

## Install
The application is available as flatpak and published on flathub as ```network.koesling.shm-modbus```.

The installation can be done with the following command: 
```
flatpak install network.koesling.shm-modbus
```

### Launch scripts
Since the execution of the individual tools via the flatpak is uncomfortable due to the long names, launch scripts are available.
- [Long commands](https://gist.github.com/NikolasK-source/cb6ce0dc20bb775e369e3a955967a969)
- [Short commands](https://gist.github.com/NikolasK-source/1da665492478ad2e12f0495e8212f641)

If these are stored in a directory that is in the PATH environment variable, they can be used to start the tools.

| Tool | Long Command | Short Command |
| - | - | - |
| Modbus TCP Client | modbus-tcp-client-shm | mbtcp |
| Modbus RTU Client | modbus-rtu-client-shm | mbrtu |
| STDIN to Modbus SHM | stdin-to-modbus-shm | stdin2mb |
| Shared Memory Dump | dump-shm | dshm |
| Shared Memory Write | write-shm | wshm |
| Shared Memory Random | shared-mem-random | shmrnd |

## Use

The primary use case of this application is the use of the individual tools from the command line.
A desktop launcher with a guided mode is available, but it only provides limited functionality.

Usage Examples (all examples assume that the lunch scripts (long commands) are installed.):
- [Modbus TCP client](examples/tcp_client.md)
- [Shared Memory Dump](examples/dump_shm.md)
- [Shared Memory Write](examples/write_shm.md)
- [Shared Memory Random](examples/shm_random.md)
- [STDIN to Modbus Shared Memory](examples/stdin_to_shm.md)

### Steps for Simulating a Modbus Client.

1. Start the appropriate Modbus client ([modbus-tcp-client-shm](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_tcp_client_shm/) or [modbus-rtu-client-shm](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_rtu_client_shm/)).
Information about the configuration of the clients can be found in their documentation.
([TCP](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_tcp_client_shm/) / [RTU](https://nikolask-source.github.io/modbus_rtu_client_shm/))

2. Use the Tools to Read and Manipulate:
  - [dump-shm](https://nikolask-source.github.io/dump_shm/) can be used to read the content of a shared memory. 
  Especially useful in connection with ```hexdump```.
  - [write-shm](https://nikolask-source.github.io/write_shm/) can be used to write the content of a shared memory.
  - [shared-mem-random](https://nikolask-source.github.io/shared_mem_random/) is a tool to write random values to a shared memory
  - [stdin-to-modbus-shm](https://nikolask-source.github.io/stdin_to_modbus_shm/) is a tool to write values to the modbus registers. It can handle various data types and endiannes.
